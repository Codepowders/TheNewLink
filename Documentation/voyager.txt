Voyager/Laravel

Start up a local development server with php artisan serve And, visit http://localhost:8000/admin.

If you installed with the dummy data, a user has been created for you with the following login credentials:

email: admin@admin.com
password: password

Quick Note
A dummy user is only created if there are no current users in your database.

If you did not go with the dummy user, you may wish to assign admin priveleges to an existing user.
This can easily be done by running this command:

php artisan voyager:admin your@email.com
If you wish to create a new admin user you can pass the --create flag, like so:

php artisan voyager:admin your@email.com --create
And you will be prompted for the users name and password.

php artisan voyager:install --with-dummy
php artisan migrate:refresh
php artisan db:seed
